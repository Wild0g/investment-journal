# Session Notes - Investment Journal Project

## Session Summary
**Date:** Current Session
**Phase:** Foundation Setup + Must-Have Features Definition
**Status:** Ready to continue with UI/UX Design

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Project Architecture
- **Type:** AI-coached, gamified investment journal PWA
- **Tech Stack:** React + TypeScript, Supabase, Vite
- **Approach:** Modular architecture for easy feature additions
- **Location:** `/mnt/c/Users/GK/Projects-Claude/investment-journal/`

### 2. Core Purpose Defined
- Help traders learn from decisions through data-driven insights
- Track hidden costs (brokerage, taxes, fees)
- Provide AI coaching for psychological patterns
- Gamify improvement tracking
- Enable post-trade analysis ("should I have held longer?")

### 3. Must-Have Features (Student Input Incorporated)
1. **Basic Trade Logging** - Manual entry with P&L calculation
2. **Data Integrity** - Duplicate detection (student suggestion!)
3. **Cost Tracking** - Brokerage and tax tracking
4. **Smart Trade Display** - Same-day grouping by scrip (student suggestion!)
5. **Simple Trade List** - Expandable rows, search/filter (student suggestion!)

### 4. Technical Foundation Complete
- ✅ Project directory structure created
- ✅ CLAUDE.md workflow rules established
- ✅ Comprehensive projectplan.md with phases
- ✅ Learning journal for concept tracking
- ✅ Modular folder structure for PWA

## Next Steps When Resuming
1. **Continue Must-Have Features** - Any additional core features needed?
2. **Design UI/UX** - Mobile-first PWA interface design
3. **Plan Database Schema** - Tables for trades, grouping, duplicates
4. **Begin Technical Implementation** - Start with Supabase + React setup

## Student Learning Progress
- Understanding of modular architecture benefits
- Recognition of real trading workflow needs (duplicates, grouping)
- Grasp of PWA advantages for investment tracking
- Teacher-student approach working well

## Key Files to Read When Resuming
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Workflow rules
2. `projectplan.md` - Comprehensive plan with current status
3. `learning-journal.md` - Concepts covered
4. `session-notes.md` - This file for context

## Resume Command
