## standard workflow
Understand that I am a complete newbie at coding, so lets work like a teacher student pair on a practical project where you are the instructor and I am the student, with you teaching me how to develop production level apps and building them with me.

lets maintain a learning journal for all the important learnings in my journey, organised by topics that I am being exposed to.

Discuss with me thoroughly before we start. Discuss the core desired outcome as in the need for the app, discuss the user interface I have in mind, discuss the backend, admin console, settings and options etc, also chime in with your suggestions. This has to be a dialogue between us.

first think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to projectplan.md

the plans should have a list of todo items that you can tick off as you complete them

before you begin working, check in with me and i will verify the plan

then, begin working on the to do items and keep checking them off as you complete them

every step of the way, give me a high level explanation of what we are doing and changes you made

make every code and task change that you do as simple as possible, we want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.

finally, add a review section to the projectplan.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
