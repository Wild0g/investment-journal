# Investment Journal - AI-Coached Trading Analytics PWA

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Create a comprehensive, AI-coached, gamified investment journal PWA that helps users become better traders through data-driven insights, cost awareness, psychological understanding, and personalized feedback.

**Core Problems Solved:**
- Lack of systematic trade reflection
- Hidden cost erosion (brokerage, taxes, fees)
- Psychological blind spots and recurring patterns
- No measurable improvement tracking
- Isolated learning without AI assistance

**Architecture:** Modular PWA with Supabase backend, React + TypeScript frontend

## AI INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### AI Personality & Communication
- **Tone:** Supportive coach, not judgmental critic
- **Style:** Brief, actionable insights with consistent personality
- **Voice:** "I notice..." rather than "You always..." | "Let's try..." rather than "You should..."

### AI Backend Implementation
**Recommended: Hybrid Approach with OpenAI GPT-4**

**Phase 1 (MVP): 90% Built-in + 10% AI**
- Built-in pattern recognition and statistical analysis
- GPT-4 for weekly deep insights only
- Cost: $5-15/month per active user

**Phase 2 (Advanced): 70% Built-in + 30% AI**
- Daily micro-feedback with AI
- Advanced behavioral psychology analysis
- Cost: $15-30/month per active user

### AI Analysis Capabilities
- **Time-based Analysis:** Day-of-week and time-of-day performance patterns
- **Behavioral Pattern Detection:** FOMO, overconfidence, loss aversion cycles
- **Stop-loss Hunting Recognition:** Identify systematic stop hunting patterns
- **Correlation Analysis:** Trigger-reason combinations and their outcomes
- **Personalized Goal Setting:** Weekly behavioral improvement targets
